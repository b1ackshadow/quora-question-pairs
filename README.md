# quora-question-pairs
<<<<<<< HEAD
Problem : Given two questions,predicting if they have same semantic meaning or not

####I have written comments extensively as much as i can

##Order of notebooks
* Quora_question_pairs.ipynb
* Quora_preprocessing.ipynb
* Quora_word2vec.ipynb
* Quora_modeling.ipynb

###I already included a saved XGBoost model with the name quora.joblib.dat
You can just load it and use as indicated in **Quora_modeling.ipynb** with joblib in sklearn

I havent included the data files as they are pretty large u can just follow notebooks and dowload the dataset from kaggle and just follow through the process.
